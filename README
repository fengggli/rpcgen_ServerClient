Make:

Notes:
    1. if you get "call failed", please check you have run the my_rpc_client with the correct server ip address
    2. For different input lists in function 2, pleae modify the line 119,120 in my_rpc_client.c
    3. For different input matrix in function 5, please modify the line 198-201 in my_rpc_client.c. You need to define the dimensions in d1 and d2, then int values in a[] and b[].
